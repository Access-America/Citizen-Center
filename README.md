# [Humanity Forward's Citizen Center](https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-M7TXW9Wpl9Jqh3Azfwc/citizenship)

## Getting Started

The Citizen Center is an open-source platform in development by [Humanity Forward](https://movehumanityforward.com/) and the [Yang Gang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Is7tdnnbYI). Through a familiar dashboard interface with a decentralized identity model, Americans will be able to connect with their government in a more secure, more simple and more instantaneous manner to propel our democracy into the 21st century.
