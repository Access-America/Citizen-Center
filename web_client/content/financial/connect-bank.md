---

There are many times when the government needs to send you money, but they currently do not have an easy way of getting that money to you. Depending on how you file your taxes, the federal government might have no straightforward way of getting your returns to you. 

The Citizen Center will allow users to attach a bank account to their profile. This makes it easy for the government to send you your [Freedom Dividend](/financial/freedom-dividend), emergency relief funds, tax returns, and more. Users will also be able to connect a Cash App account, as a modern alternative to traditional banking institutions.

### Problems it solves:
- A way for the government to quickly provide you your much needed funds, regardless of how you filed your taxes
- The simplicity of all your money going straight into your bank account
- Peace of mind knowing that your crucial relief checks are not being sent through the mail
