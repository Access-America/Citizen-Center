title: Pay Fines

A common way for federal and local agencies to make revenue is to have various fees for different civic services or violations. Many official forms come with filing fees, and if you forget to bring your checkbook, it can impede your formâ€™s processing in the system. 

There is no current centralized location where different agencies can bill you for whatever dues they are owed. You will be able to pay filing fees, property taxes, driving tickets, and more, right from the Citizen Center.

### Problems it solves:
- Pay for all of your fees and dues in one place
- A complete history of all the fines you owe, so you never have to question whether or not you already paid
- Provides an efficient method for federal and local governments to collect their money
