Keeping track of all your receipts and taxes over the years is a daunting, unnecessary task. Americans have thick folders in their homes in an attempt to keep track of their finances. The Citizen Center will keep a log of all your tax history, so it is easy to go back and see what you paid, when you paid it, and who you paid it to.  

### Problems it solves:
- Your past tax history will not get lost
- Have a constant record of the money you have paid over the years
- Easily compare different tax returns to see where things differ
