The Citizen Center will be accessible to everyone. Whether youâ€™re a U.S. citizen, a U.S. resident, or someone looking for helpful civic information, the Citizen Center will be a valuable resource for you.

Different features in the Citizen Center will be available for different kinds of users:
- **Guest** - someone browsing the site
- **User** - create an account with an email address
- **Resident** - a verified U.S. resident
- **Citizen** - a verified U.S. citizen

With the help of [Decentralized Identity (DID)](/profile/did) technology, the Citizen Center will be able to verify users who are U.S. citizens or U.S. residents. Once you have authenticated your account using DID, many more features open up for you, such as participating in the [Citizen Survey](/on-the-pulse/citizen-survey). 

You can also browse the site as a guest, or as a user with an email address. This will give you access to the baseline features, such as, [Register To Vote](/elections/register-to-vote), [Receive Notifications](/profile/notifications), or [Viewing The American Scorecard](/on-the-pulse/american-scorecard).

### Problems it solves:
- Allows anyone to access the Citizen Center, regardless of their citizenship or residency status
- Provides additional functionality to those users who wish to verify their identities
