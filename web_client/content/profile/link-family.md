The Citizen Center will allow you to link other accounts to your own, so you can keep your family members close. Everyone in America is eligible to have an account on the Citizen Center, even children. Parents will have access to their children’s accounts until they turn 18 years old. 

This also streamlines tax returns. You will not have to work out who is claiming whom as a dependent - the Citizen Center will keep track of all of that.

### Problems it solves:
- Creates a reliable network of accounts between different people
- Allows parents to manage their children’s information
- Makes filing taxes easier
