Americans cannot make informed decisions if they are not properly informed. The Citizen Center will allow users to opt-in to notifications via text or email. This can be done at a local, state, or federal level. 

Your state might have an important announcement regarding how businesses are going to respond to COVID-19, or the federal government might want to send out a reminder to everyone that it is voting day!

Direct and up-to-date communication about policies, directives, and important information is essential. They provide Americans with a sense of inclusivity, and lets them know that our government wants them to stay safe, healthy, and informed.

### Problems it solves:
- There is no single source of important government information. Your state governor might make an important announcement, but if you do not happen to read the news that day, you could miss it.
- Keeps Americans up to date on current events and policies
- Ensures no one is left out of the loop
