title: Apply for Unemployment
order: 2
---

The current methods for applying for unemployment in our states is archaic. Americans have to call a hotline and suffer through long hold times, phone disconnections, and inexplicable busy signals. Why is applying for unemployment not as simple as filling out a form online?

U.S. residents who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs should not have to then endure a painstaking process to get relief. The Citizen Center will make filing for unemployment easier than ever before. Simply fill out an online application explaining your situation, and the application will be submitted for review. No phone calls, no long wait times, and no frustration. 

### Problems it solves:
- Makes it easier to file for unemployment
- Does not kick Americans when they are already down
- Streamlines the currently inefficient and unnecessary government agencies
