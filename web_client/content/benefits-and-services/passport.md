title: Apply or Renew a Passport
order: 3
---

With the upcoming [REAL ID](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) act, having an up to date passport is going to become a lot more important. You will need a REAL ID, such as a passport or a specially updated driverâ€™s license, to board any public airline, for both international and domestic flights. 

The current process for applying for or renewing a U.S. passport is slow, tedious, and frustrating - it is the classic case of a government system that begs for improvement. The Citizen Center will make renewing a passport as simple and stress-free as possible. If you are authenticated with [DID](/profile/did), the Citizen Center can safely and securely get a renewed passport to you quickly.

### Problems it solves:
- Ensures Americans can continue to board public flights after the REAL ID act takes effect
- Makes it easier to renew a passport, without having to jump through all the existing hoops
