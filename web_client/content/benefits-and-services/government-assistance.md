The story of every American is different. They come from different backgrounds, homes, schools, and environments. Their struggles are as unique as they are as individuals, and a role of the government should be to help them when they need it.

There are many different government assistance programs, such as food stamps, welfare, temporary assistance, or child healthcare. These social programs are vital to helping our most vulnerable citizens, and it should not be difficult to apply to them. The Citizen Center will make it easy for anyone to apply to various government assistance programs. Americans deserve the services that are available to them, without having to worry about difficult application processes.

### Problems it solves:
