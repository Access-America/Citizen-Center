There is a severe lack of trust that lives within the American people today. Citizens do not feel their needs are being met, or that their problems are being listened to. In an effort to repair the connection between citizens and their government, the Citizen Center will offer the Citizen Survey.

Citizen Survey is a place where U.S. residents can vote on populist issues. These issues could be at a federal, state, or local level. The polls will regularly rotate through, so Americans can come back often to vote on new questions. Past questions and voter results will always be available, making it easy to see how the views of U.S. residents have changed over time. 

When a user casts their vote, their congressional district will be identified, allowing the Citizen Center to break down results at a state or district level. This makes it easier to [Contact Congressional Representatives](/on-the-pulse/contact-representatives) with the needs and desires of their constituents.

### Problems it solves:
- Allows the American people to easily vote on populist issues
- Holds congressional representatives more accountable, because the American peopleâ€™s voices are clear
- Provides more data as to where the country is headed
