Congresspeople are the elected officials who should be directly representing their constituents. Each state votes for two senators, and a number of House representatives, proportional to the stateâ€™s population.

The American people should have the ear of these representatives. It is already possible to contact your congresspeople, but the Citizen Center will make it easier than ever. Knowing what state you live in, it will provide clear contact information for each of your reps, both at a state level, and for your particular congressional district.

### Problems it solves:
- Makes it easier for constituents to contact their representatives
- Increases trust that your congresspeople are listening to your needs
- Helps to keep the congresspeople accountable
