The United States Census is an invaluable tool for the federal government, but the data is only useful if it is accurate. To facilitate this, the U.S. Census should be as easy to complete as possible, so that every demographic can be represented and accounted for. The Citizen Center will have a section of the site dedicated to informing people about the census, with the ability to fill it out. The responses would be sent to the U.S. Census Bureau.

### Problems it solves:
- Informs people about how important the U.S. Census is
- Makes it easier to fill out the census
- Helps to improve the statistical representations of different groups
