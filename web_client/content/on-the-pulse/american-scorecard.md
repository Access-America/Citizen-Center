title: View The American Scorecard
order: 6
---

Many pundits claim that the stock market is a good indicator of how the American people are doing, while others point to specific spending numbers or GDP growth. The truth is, none of these metrics are the best measurements for how a country’s citizens are actually doing. America needs a new scorecard.

We should be measuring against things like:
- Environmental quality
- Childhood success rate
- Quality of infrastructure
- Access to education
- Marriage and divorce rates
- Income inequality
- Mental health

The quality of an American’s life cannot be reduced to a single number. We need to be paying attention to the real, everyday circumstances that Americans face. If we cannot accurately get a sense of where Americans are struggling, how can we expect to solve their problems?

### Problems it solves:
- Does not reduce people to their economic value
- Improves our overall view of the country’s health
- Provides a tool for improving areas where the country is lacking
