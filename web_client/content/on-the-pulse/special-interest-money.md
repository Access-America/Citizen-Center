title: Review Special Interest Money in Politics
order: 2
---

Money is the driving force behind a lot of moves that are made in Washington. Organizations and Special Interest Groups lobby for congress people to vote a certain way, or to push legislation that would be beneficial to them. The oil industry lobbies against clean energy. The automotive industry lobbies against self-driving cars.

These groups drown out the voice of the American people. At the very least, the money donated to politicians by Special Interest Groups should be available to the public. The Citizen Center will present this information, in order to hold politicians and groups accountable for the biases they are working with.

### Problems it solves:
- Shines a light on Special Interest Groups
- Keep politicians accountable as to where their funding comes from
- Informs citizens about where their voices are being suppressed
