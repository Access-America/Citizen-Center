The members of the United States Congress people elected are the representatives who speak for the American people. Many of these politicians have been in the game for decades, and have a large history of different bills and amendments they have voted for. 

If a constituent wanted to find out who their representatives voted for, it would require a good amount of research. The voting records of these electors should be more easily accessible. The Citizen Center will provide this transparency, which will help Americans trust the government more. All of your senate and house membersâ€™ voting records will be available,, so you know if they are actually voting the way you want them to.

### Problems it solves:
