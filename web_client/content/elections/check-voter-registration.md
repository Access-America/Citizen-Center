order: 2
---

The rules for when you need to re-register to vote can be confusing, and they vary state by state. Checking your voter registration status will be as easy as logging into the Citizen Center and viewing your account. Your registration status will always be available to view, so you can rest assured that you will not run into any issues on voting day.

### Problems it solves:
- Knowing if your old registration is still in effect
- Understanding when you need to update your registration if you move 
- Peace of mind knowing that your registration is up to date
